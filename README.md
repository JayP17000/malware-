# MALWARE ANALYSIS PROJECT (RUNYara)
...
## OVERVIEW
The **Malware Analysis Project (RUNYara)** is a project that we created
to detect viruses using a Malware Analyzer. The purpose
of this software tool is to help PC users detect malicious
files that may be contained within their computer. The Malware
Analyzer will ask the user to open a directory from their
PC, so that the analyzer can scan each file within the directory.
Once a directory is selected, the malware analyzer will scan through
each file and determine if the file is safe or contains a malicious
threat. After, the user can view the results of the scan by opening
the result tab, and once this window is open, it will show a csv file 
containing all the files scanned, with information of whether the
file is malicious or not, the date and time of when the file was scan,
and if there was a threat it will determine which yara rule that it found.

## PRE-REQUISITES
The following software must be installed within your PC before executing this
program:
- PyCharm IDE
- PySide 6
- Python 3.11
- Git

## INSTALLATION

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (or Download Zip)
If you have not cloned the repository in any of the previous
steps above, you can either clone it using Git or download the 
project as a zip file and then extract it.\
**Option 1: Cloning the Repository**: Open your terminal or 
command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/JayP17000/malware-.git
```

**Option 2: Download Zip**: If you prefer not to use Git, you can download
the project as a zip file from the repository's GitHub page and extract
it to a directory of your choice.

### Step 2: Open the Project in Your IDE (PyCharm)
Launch your PyCharm IDE, and select "Open Folder" or "Open Project" 
from the IDE's menu. Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted
the *VTA* and select it.

### Step 3: Set up the Virtual Environment (venv)
To keep the project dependencies isolated, it's recommended to set up a virtual
environment within your PyCharm IDE. The steps for creating a virtual
environment may vary based on the IDE you are using:

- [How to create a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)
- [How to create a virtual environment in PyCharm] (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (if not using virtual environment)
If you haven't set up a virtual environment, you can install the project dependencies
globally by opening a terminal or command prompt within your PyCharm IDE and running 
the following command:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 5: Configure the Project (Optional)
If the project requires configuration, make any adjustments within your
PyCharm IDE. This could include setting environment variables or updating
configuration files.

### Step 6: Run the Project
Now you are ready to run the **Malware Analysis Project (RUNYara)** tool from
your IDE. You can run the main script by right-clicking it in the IDE's
file explorer and selecting "Run" or "Debug".

Note: Update the version info of the versionfile.txt and the program code in
gui_main respectively.

### Step 1: Install or Update Pyinstaller
```commandline
pip install Pyinstaller
```

### Step 2: Run Pyinstaller on the ".Spec" file found on the root directory
```commandline
Pyinstaller VT.spec
```

### Step 3 (Optional): Run the following command on the root directory
### MAC:
```commandline
Pyinstaller --onedir -w src/main.py --icon=vt_icon.png --name=VT --version-file=verisonfile.txt
```
### Windows:
